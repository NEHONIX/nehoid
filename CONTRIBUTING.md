## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer const over let. Never use var
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Reference methods and classes with backticks: `NehoID.generate()`
- Include code examples for all public methods

## Important Notes

### Real Implementation Requirements

As per our development philosophy, we do not accept any mock implementations or placeholder code. All contributions must include real, functional implementations that fulfill the promised behavior.

### TODOs and FIXMEs

When submitting code, please ensure all TODOs and FIXMEs are addressed. If you find existing TODOs or FIXMEs in the codebase, consider addressing them as part of your contribution.
